# modbus-reloaded

A expandable Particle library for modbus communication

## Welcome to Modbus Reloaded!

This project was born from the limitations and inconveniences I spent fixing in my [ModBusMaster-Electron library](https://github.com/peergum/ModbusMaster-Electron), an adaptation of the [ModBusMaster Arduino library by 4-20ma](https://github.com/4-20ma/ModbusMaster) for the Electron.

Strong of my knowledge and experience during the last 3 years, I decided I could do better, not just for myself but for the whole community out there that suffers the annoyances of interfacing with ModBus devices.

## Usage

See the [examples](examples) folder for more details.
